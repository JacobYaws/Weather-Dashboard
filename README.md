## Overview
-For this project, I had to use bootstrap for the structuring and styling on the page. 
-I used the OpenWeather API to pull all of the weather data for a certain area. Afterwards, I had to extract all of the relevant data that was needed display on the page. Because of the amount of data that was returned, I was only able to display a forecast for the current day and 4 days into the future.
-I used localstorage to store previous searches into a search history section. Whenever the user searches for a city, it will automatically create a button for that city, which is also able to pull up that city's weather data upon clicking.
